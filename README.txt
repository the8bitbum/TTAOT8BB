Instructions for The Texty Adventures of the 8-Bit Bum,

note* in order to play this game you must have java runtime environment
installed if you do not google JRE and download it... you should have it 
already but heck what do i know.*
 
1. Only I repeat ONLY put in the Number of the option 
you want otherwise things will be messed up. If you enter
another number other than 1 or 2 or the given options, it will
not run the story properly and you will miss out so i suggest
you follow this rule!
2. This game is supposed to be funny and not serious, 
so do not complain about how the characters,
know they are in a game that is the point.
3. I realize the game needs work it is my first game,
so I went simple.
4. Do not claim this game as you're own its not nice.
5. Have a FUN time playing!!!!! (FREAKIN UBER NICE time)
6... OH YEAH! how to start the game, open up a Command window,
by using either the steps in Instruction 8 or opening the start menu
and typing cmd.
7. Find the directory where Main.class is, and navigate to it andd enter "java Main"
Example of instruction 7:
C:\Users\Patrick\Workspace\The Texty Adventures of The 8-Bit Bum\bin>java Main
8. If you cannot figure out how to get to the proper directory in the Command window, 
do this: open windows explore, go to where you have it saved Left shift and
right click at the same time in an empty space, and then left click
"Open command window here" and it should bring you to where you can just type
"java Main" and it should Start the game.


*For those of you who know how to do this sorry it is more for my friends who do not*
